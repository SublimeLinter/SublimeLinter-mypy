SublimeLinter-mypy
==========================

[![tests](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-mypy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-mypy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


This linter plugin for [SublimeLinter][docs] provides an interface to [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org). It will be used with files that have the "python" syntax.

## Installation
SublimeLinter 4 must be installed in order to use this plugin. If SublimeLinter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here][installation].

### Linter installation
Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `mypy` is installed on your system. To install `mypy`, do the following:

1. Install [Python](http://python.org/download/) and [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).

1. Install `mypy` by typing the following in a terminal:
   ```
   [sudo] pip install mypy
   ```


**Note:** This plugin requires `mypy` 0.520 or later.

### Linter configuration
In order for `mypy` to be executed by SublimeLinter, you must ensure that its path is available to SublimeLinter. Before going any further, please read and follow the steps in [“Finding a linter executable”](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#finding-a-linter-executable) through “Validating your PATH” in the documentation.

Once you have installed and configured `mypy`, you can proceed to install the SublimeLinter-contrib-mypy plugin, if it is not yet installed.

### Plugin installation
Please use [Package Control][pc] to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we won’t cover that here.

To install via Package Control, do the following:

1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette][cmd] (*Tools → Command Palette…*) and select `Package Control: Install Package`. There may be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available packages.

1. When the package list appears, select `SublimeLinter-contrib-mypy`.

## Settings
For general information on how SublimeLinter works with settings, please see [Settings][settings]. For information on generic linter settings, please see [Linter Settings][linter-settings].

Following is a list of *additional* settings specific to this linter:

|Setting|Description|
|:------|:----------|
|cache-dir|The directory to store the cache in. Creates a sub-folder in your temporary directory if not specified. Set it to `false` to disable this automatic behavior, for example if the cache location is set in your mypy.ini file.|
|follow-imports|Whether imports should be followed and linted. The default is `"silent"` for speed, but `"normal"` or `"skip"` may also be used.|
|show-error-codes|Set to `false` for older mypy versions, or better yet update mypy.|

All other args to mypy should be specified in the `args` list directly.
